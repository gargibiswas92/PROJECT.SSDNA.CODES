The .dat file is divided into the parts
   i. the part before P-P dihedrals of the DNA (test0.dat)
   ii. the part containing P-P dihedrals of the DNA (test1.dat)
   iii. the part after the P-P dihedrals of the DNA (test2.dat)
   iv. the part containing structure (struct200.dat/ struct400.dat etc.)
   
   The the part(ii) is read with the python script
   And appropriate modification is done
   
   For different initial structures(e.g., end-to-end distance= 222A, 420 A etc.) the part(iv) will be different

# Making of structure with 235 nt DNA:  
1. We added some repulsions.  
2. Concatenated that repulsion file to the .dat file.  
3. After modification of the contacts or dihedrals I appropriately modified the .dat file.  
4. After modification of the structure an the axis also, I appropriately modified the .dat file.  
5. I applied pulling to the both ends of this structure, to get a force-strained structures.  
6. So I have five structures where end-to-end distances are 222, 420, 620, 812 and 994 angstorms respectively.  
7. Also, for all this structures, I modified the dihedral potential for four consecutive phosphate beads in the DNA, to change the persistance length of  the DNA, and hence to model the effect of different salt concentrations.

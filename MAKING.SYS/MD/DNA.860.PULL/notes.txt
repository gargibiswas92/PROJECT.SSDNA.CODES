#The force is exerted on the bead 1340
#The force is exerted on the bead 1517

#The forces are applied along 1060 to 321 (protein beads) on 1517
#And from 781 to 552 (protein beads) on bead 1340

#The value of the force is constant, direction is also constant

#For calculation of the direction cosine, the initial positions of the beads 321, 1060, 781 and 552 have been considered.

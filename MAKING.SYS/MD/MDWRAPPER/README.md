# Commands for MDWrapper:  
1. We mainly used the MDWrapper.pl file named as MDWrapper_ssDNA_pull_vp.pl to run the simulations.  
2. The MDWrapper_ssDNA_pull_vp.pl should be kept in a folder same as the .schema and MDW.lock.  
3. The folder having the .dat file will have a MDWrapper.prefs file which will contain all the preferences for the simulation.

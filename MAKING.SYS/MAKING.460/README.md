# Making of structure with 460 nt DNA:  
1. We added some repulsions.  
2. Concatenated that repulsion file to the .dat file.  
3. After modification of the contacts or dihedrals I appropriately modified the .dat file.  
4. After modification of the structure an the axis also, I appropriately modified the .dat file.

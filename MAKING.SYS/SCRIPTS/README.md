# README for generateMDInput:  
1. Here, we have the scripts for generating a .dat files from a .pdb file.  
2. Since we have both protein and DNA in the .pdb file I used the generateMDInput.pl from the generateMDInputproteindna directory.  
3. We have to have a generateMDInput.prefs file in the directory, where we will have the .pdb file.
4. Then we will use the generateMDInput.pl from the generateMDInputproteindna directory. In this directory we have to have the generateMDInput.prefs.schema file.  
5. Also for running this generateMDInput.pl we will be needing a util/ directory. The util directory will contain all the necessary components for generating the .dat file

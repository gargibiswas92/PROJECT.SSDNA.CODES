# Modifications in the ssDNA with 60 nt:  
1. Here are some codes for ssDNA with 60 nt length.  
2. The generateMDInput.pl creates the CG model as always.  
3. Here no modifications were done except for changing the dihedral potentials.   
4. To get the directions between any two beads I used get_dir.py code.
